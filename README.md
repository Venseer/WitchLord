Utility for checking issues with AngelScript
Similiar to ASCompiler, but aiming to be "clean" environment - without preprocessor or any FOnline-related stuff.

Features:
- loading multiple modules from source and/or bytecode
- if module is loaded from source, its bytecode can be saved for further tests
- executing specific functions after compilation
